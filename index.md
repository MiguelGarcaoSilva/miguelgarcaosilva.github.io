## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

Hiüëã! I am a PhD student at the [Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon](https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/) (FCUL), conducting research at [LASIGE](https://www.lasige.pt/). I am supervised by [Professor Sara Madeira](https://saracmadeira.wordpress.com/) from FCUL and [Professor Piero Fariselli](http://www.biocomp.unibo.it/piero/) from the [Department of Medical Sciences of the University of Turin](https://dms.campusnet.unito.it/do/home.pl).

My current research focuses on improving neurodegenerative disease prognosis, with particular attention to ALS and MS, using Deep Learning. I am especially interested in learning whether these Deep Learning solutions are also robust and trustworthy ([here's a paper related to that](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.113/)).

I am interested in Deep Learning as a field overall and its applicability to many problems. I have conducted research in Natural Language Processing previously, at the [NLX-Group](http://nlx.di.fc.ul.pt/). My [Msc Dissertation](https://github.com/nlx-group/study-of-commonsense-reasoning), supervised by [Professor Ant√≥nio Branco](http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~ahb/) to obtain a Masters in Data Science, focused on a particular problem named [Shortcut Learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00257-z), specifically when learning commonsense reasoning.

For a more thorough and structured description of my work, you may check [my CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IkYwV90qBOrX6z_5EVxYhzMBOBnBBZLO/view).

## Research Interests

I am interested in many topics beyond these (like Physics, Psychology, etc.) and am always looking forward to collaborations (given the time). If you have a problem you would like to collaborate on, feel free to [contact me](#contact).
